 <p>Drake is dropping a new album. I was very excited cause he dropped a new single with SZA but he said he's postponing the album for about a month.
     I liked the song but I hoped the album would come sooner. Plus, Drake's part isn't even that good SZA carries the singing and in the beginning he just sounds bad. 
     He picks it up in the end with the last verse that was pretty good but other than that SZA really made this her song. It's whatever anyways, this made me realize Drake is an 36 year old deadbeat to be honest, and his albums have 
    been mostly trash for the past like 7 years with some good songs being an exception here and there. As he's gotten older he's gotten worse to listen to it's like, you're pushing 40 bro why do I have to hear you 
    talk and complain about the same stuff in every song. It's like he's gotten lamer with every year which is why people hold his old music to such high regard.</p>

    It doesn't really matter for real I don't think I'll be too excited for the album this time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3RaCGXCiiMufRPoexXxGkV?si=d30e538404c847e0&nd=1" target="_blank">Listen to the song and rate it for me.</a>
